/* Variable declarations begin with two dashes (-) and are given a name and a value like this:
 --variable-name: value;. In the rule for the bb1 class, create a variable named --building-color1 and give it a value of #999.
 To use a variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var in front of them like this: 
 var(--variable-name). Whatever value you gave the variable will be applied to whatever property you use it on.

Add the variable --building-color1 you created in the previous step as the value of the background-color property of the .bb1a class.*/



/*variables are often declared in the :root selector. This is the highest level selector in CSS; putting your variables there will make them usable everywhere. 
Add the :root selector to the top of your stylesheet, and move all your variable declarations there.*/




/*Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. 
They are applied to the background property and the syntax looks like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2
);
In the example, color1 is solid at the top, color2 is solid at the bottom, and in between it transitions evenly from one to the next. In .bb1a, add a background property below the background-color property. 
Set it as a gradient of type linear-gradient that uses --building-color1 as the first color and --window-color1 as the second.*/

/*You can see the hard color change at the top of the section. Change the gradient type from linear-gradient to repeating-linear-gradient for 
this section. This will make the four colors of your gradient repeat until it gets to the bottom of the element; giving you some stripes, 
and saving you from having to add a bunch of elements to create them.

background: repeating-linear-gradient(
      var(--building-color2),
      var(--building-color2) 6%,
      var(--window-color2) 6%,
      var(--window-color2) 9%
    );
    */
