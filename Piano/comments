/ To create the black keys, add a new .key.black--key::after selector. This will target the elements with the class key black--key, 
and select the pseudo-element after these elements in the HTML.

In the new selector, set the background-color to #1d1e22. Also set the content property to "". This will make the pseudo-elements empty.

The content property is used to set or override the content of the element. By default, the pseudo-elements created by the ::before and ::after
pseudo-selectors are empty, and the elements will not be rendered to the page.Setting the content property to an empty string "" will ensure the element is rendered to the page while still being empty.

If you would like to experiment, try removing the background-color property and setting different values for the content property, such as "â™¥". Remember to undo these changes when you are done so the tests pass.*/



/*The @media at-rule, also known as a media query, is used to conditionally apply CSS. Media queries are commonly used to apply CSS based on the viewport width using the max-width and min-width properties.

In the below example the padding is applied to the .card class when the viewport is 960px wide and below.

@media (max-width: 960px) {
  .card {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}
Add a media query that will be applied when the viewport is 768px wide and below.*/



/*You might have noticed the keys collapse when the browser window is smaller than 768px. Set overflow to hidden in the first .keys selector, to take care of this issue. This property will hide any element that is pushed outside the set width value of .keys.*/
